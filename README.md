# Hierarchical-Zeolites-
Designing and executing laboratory experiments for the synthesis of hierarchical zeolites, focusing on enhancing porosity and catalytic performance. Applied statistical Design of Experiments (DOE) using Minitab/JMP to systematically optimize synthesis parameters such as temperature, time, and surfactant concentration.
Studying the catalytic performance of synthesized hierarchical zeolites by evaluating conversion rates and product selectivity in model reactions. Conducted detailed material characterization using techniques such as BET and T-plot.
